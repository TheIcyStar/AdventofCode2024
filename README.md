Here to get some extra practice with C++ 23. The project is set up to build and debug using VSCode, but it can still be ran just through the CLI.

#### Prerequisites
g++ with c++23 support (I used g++ 13.3.0), make

#### Run in VSCode:
0. Be on Linux or use WSL
1. Select "Linux gdb launch with args prompt" in the run tab
2. Press F5 and put in the day number and the part number to run in VSCode's prompts

#### Run with CLI:
0. Be on Linux or use WSL
1. `make && ./build/app.out <day> <part>`, where \<day\> and \<part\> are numbers
